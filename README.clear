When either the NAME or the PRETTY_NAME of the
operating system changes, as defined in the
os-release file, the following will be impacted:
- Ansible fails to recongize the operating system
  and Ceph deployments fail
- WALinuxAgent for Azure fails to recognize the
  operating system and integration in the
  Microsoft cloud fails
